# Introduction to Hugging Face and Using its Models

Welcome to this session on using Hugging Face models! This guide is designed to introduce you to the world of Hugging Face and empower you to leverage its powerful tools and pre-trained models for various machine learning tasks.

## What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is an open-source platform that has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is rapidly expanding into other domains like computer vision and audio. Its core mission is to democratize access to cutting-edge machine learning models and tools, making it easier for everyone to build and deploy AI applications.

Think of Hugging Face as a central hub for the ML community, offering:

*   **A vast Model Hub:** A repository of thousands of pre-trained models for various tasks, contributed by researchers and developers worldwide. You can find models for text classification, translation, summarization, image recognition, audio transcription, and much more.
*   **Powerful Libraries:** Open-source libraries like `transformers`, `datasets`, and `tokenizers` that provide easy-to-use interfaces for working with models, datasets, and text processing.
*   **A Collaborative Community:** A vibrant community of ML practitioners who share models, datasets, and expertise.

Hugging Face significantly reduces the barrier to entry for using state-of-the-art ML models, allowing you to quickly experiment and build applications without having to train models from scratch.

## Managing Hugging Face Tokens

To access some models or features on the Hugging Face Hub, you might need to use an API token. This token helps authenticate your requests and can be used to interact with the Hub programmatically, including downloading gated models or uploading your own.

Here's how you can manage and verify your Hugging Face token:

1.  **Obtain a Token:** Go to your Hugging Face profile settings (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and generate a new access token. You can choose different roles for the token (e.g., read, write).
2.  **Store your Token Securely:** It's crucial to store your token securely. In Google Colab, you can use the "Secrets" feature (ðŸ”‘ icon in the left panel) to store your token as an environment variable. Name your secret `HF_TOKEN`.
3.  **Log in Programmatically:** You can use the `huggingface_hub` library to log in to the Hugging Face Hub using your token.

!pip install huggingface_hub

from huggingface_hub import whoami
from google.colab import userdata

# Get your Hugging Face token from Colab Secrets
hf_token = userdata.get('HF_TOKEN')

# Verify the token by checking your identity
try:
    user_info = whoami(token=hf_token)
    print(f"Logged in as: {user_info['name']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not log in: {e}")
    print("Please make sure you have added your Hugging Face token to Colab Secrets with the name 'HF_TOKEN'")
Let's add a code block to install the necessary library and verify your token.
